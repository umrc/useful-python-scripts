## virustotal-api-folder-check.py

This code is a Python script that scans files in a specified directory using the VirusTotal API. It calculates the hash of each file using the SHA256 algorithm and then checks if the file has been previously scanned on VirusTotal. If the file is found on VirusTotal, it retrieves the analysis statistics, including the number of malicious, suspicious, and undetected verdicts. The script outputs the detection status of each file in the directory, indicating the number of detected and undetected instances.
